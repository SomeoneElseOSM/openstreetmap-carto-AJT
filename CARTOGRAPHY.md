# Cartography

OSM-carto's [CARTOGRPAHY.md](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/CARTOGRAPHY.md) file describes the goals for the "standard" osm.org map style.

The goals of this variant are instead to:

* Show England and Wales access rights ("designation=public_footpath" etc.) using OSM-carto's styles for footway, bridleway and the various tracktypes.

* Show the features that someone might want to walk to and via at zoom level 13 - so show field boundaries, stiles and gates at that lavel.

* Show names for various non-building areas that have names.
